// swift-tools-version:5.10
/// TrideKit — plays Tride scenes (`.trd`) in an iOS app: the Tride runtime (`TrideCore`, a binary
/// xcframework), the Filament renderer (a binary xcframework) and a SwiftUI view over them.
///
/// ## Public API
/// - `TrideKit` — `TrideKitScene` (load a `.trd`, bindings, triggers, events, play / pause, which
///   runtime build — `buildInfo`) and `FilamentMetalView` (the SwiftUI view that draws it).
/// - `TrideCore` — the runtime's own types (`TrideValue`, `TrideBindingDescriptor`, …).
/// - `TrideMaterials` — a build-tool plugin for the app target that bundles `.trd` scenes: their
///   materials ship as precompiled Metal libraries, so an iPhone's first run does not compile them.
///
/// ## Non-obvious constraints
/// - Generated from the Tride repository (`SNAPSHOT.md`): do not edit it here — the next release
///   replaces it.
/// - iOS 17+, arm64 only (device and Apple-silicon simulator). On macOS (arm64 only) there is no
///   Filament: `TrideKit` compiles to a re-export of `TrideCore`.
/// - No unsafe flags: the ObjC++ bridge to Filament ships compiled (`TrideKitFilamentBridge`), so the
///   package can be added by URL. Its materials ride in TrideKit's resources.
